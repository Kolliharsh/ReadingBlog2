        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
             <p>My hobby is reading. It brings us into a world where dreams become reality and we have a chance to escape into that world. They also give us incredible amounts of knowledge , that is very useful for us to apply into the real world. Reading is a useful and fantastic hobby. Most of the successful people in the world , read at least 30 minutes per day. So you see ... reading is wonderful and knowledgeable . You may think you or someone else reads too much but you are wrong , it is you who are under estimating them. No matter what you read , you will improve every day . You don't need to only read this or that anything will make a change to your reading ability.Reading has been here forever. It has just evoled from different things. Like in the beggining of time , when there were cavemen and stuff like that ... reading was trying to intercept the drawings . Now in modern times , we can read stuff everywhere.Like road signs , books and many more. We read the drawings , writings , signs, and in the future a new type of reading might come . I trust that reading will live until the end of time and continue to devlop more and more ...</p>
